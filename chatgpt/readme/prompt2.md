### Response

Do you mean:
- Small language model (machine learning)
- Selective laser melting (metal 3D printers)
- Spatial light modulator (optics)
- Something else?

If you mean small language model: “cheapest” depends on whether you want a hosted API or to self-host. Quick pointers:
- Self-host (effectively cheapest): tiny open models like Phi-3.5-mini (≈3–4B), Qwen2.5-1.5B/3B, or Llama 3.x 3B run on a laptop or a single low-cost GPU; cost is essentially your hardware/electricity.
- Hosted APIs (historically low cost): OpenAI gpt-4o-mini and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash have been among the lowest per-token general models; low-cost hosts also offer Llama 3/3.1 8B at budget rates. Exact “cheapest” changes frequently—best to compare current input/output token prices versus your expected token mix.

If you clarify which SLM and whether you want API or self-host, your region, and expected volume, I can name the cheapest option and estimate your monthly cost.
